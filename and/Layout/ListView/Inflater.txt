inflation: converting XML appearance definition into java view objects in code is called inflattion

very time consuming
take a xml view,create its java object,set values for all attributes, and recursively repeat for all its child nodes
use the getSystemService() or getLayoutInflater() to create an object of LayoutInflater

only precompiled xml files by the aapt can be inflated during runtime for performance

How does it work
----------------
LayoutInflater I=getLayoutInflater();
View v=I.inflate(int resource,ViewGroup parent)

resource=name of xml layout file that you want to inflate
parent=a layout that you would use as a parent for v in the viewHierarchy

parent is optional

I.inflate(R.layout.sublayout,null) is valid   -->sublayout.xml in res folder

what is v? the root view representing resource(sublayout.xml-->textview).



View v=I.inflate(R.layout.sublayout,null)
what v contains--textview
Parent of v--null
Layout params--null

u r not added to layout
Adding v to the frame(or linear layout)
FrameLayout f=(FrameLayout)findViewById(R.id.myframe);
f.addView(v);

activity_main.xml

  FrameLayout
    LinearLayout
      Textview

sublayout.xml
 textview

addint v to the LinearLayout

View v-I.inflate(R.layout.sublayout,null)
Linearlayout l=(LinearLayout)findViewById(R.id.mylinear)
l.addView(v);

2)on calling inflate method with parent

View v=I.inflate(R.layout.sublayout,linear)
parent as your linearlayout

what v contains--linearlayout
parent of v-framelayout
layoutparams--framelayout

automatically added to the linearlayout,so dont call addView.
it is the same as saying
I.inflate(R.layout.sublayout,linear,true)

true--attach to root which means R.layout.sublayout should be inflated and made a part of the parent linear.

false--attach to root which means R.layout.sublayout should be inflated and not made a part of the linear but it should use the LayoutParams specified by Linear.


I.inflate(R.layout.sublayout,linear)
I.inflate(R.layout.sublayout,linear,true)  
both contain a reference to linearlayout in v
we want a reference to the textview so that we can directly manipulate it.
I.inflate(R.layout.sublayout,linear,false) textview  null  LinearLayout
  view directly no need linearlayout
what v contains textview
parent of v null
Layout params  LinearLayout
