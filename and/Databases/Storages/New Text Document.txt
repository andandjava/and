sharedpreferences
-----------------
xml file
stores in key-value pair
stores primitive data types like boolean,int,float,strings etc

The SharedPreferences class provides a general framework that allows you to save and retrieve persistent key-value pairs of primitive data types. You can use SharedPreferences to save any primitive data: booleans, floats, ints, longs, and strings. This data will persist across user sessions (even if your application is killed).	
To get a SharedPreferences object for your application, use one of two methods:

getSharedPreferences() - Use this if you need multiple preferences files identified by name, which you specify with the first parameter.
getPreferences() - Use this if you need only one preferences file for your Activity. Because this will be the only preferences file for your Activity, you don't supply a name.

To write values:

Call edit() to get a SharedPreferences.Editor.
Add values with methods such as putBoolean() and putString().
Commit the new values with commit()
To read values, use SharedPreferences methods such as getBoolean() and getString().
