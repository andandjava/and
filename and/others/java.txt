1. Abstraction solves the problem in the design level.

1. Encapsulation solves the problem in the implementation level.

2. Abstraction is used for hiding the unwanted data and giving relevant data.

2. Encapsulation means hiding the code and data into a single unit to protect the data from outside world.


3. Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it

3. Encapsulation means hiding the internal details or mechanics of how an object does something.

4. Abstraction- Outer layout, used in terms of design.
For Example:-
 Outer Look of a Mobile Phone, like it has a display screen and keypad buttons to dial a number.

4. Encapsulation- Inner layout, used in terms of implementation.
For Example:- Inner Implementation detail of a Mobile Phone, how keypad button and Display Screen are connect with each other using circuits.
=====================
Abstraction and Encapsulation in Java are two important Object oriented programming concept and they are completely different to each other.

Encapsulation is a process of binding or wrapping the data and the codes that operates on the data into a single entity. This keeps the data safe from outside interface and misuse.

Abstraction is the concept of hiding irrelevant details.In other words make complex system simple by hiding the unnecessary detail from the user.

Abstraction is implemented in Java using interface and abstract class while Encapsulation is implemented using private, package-private and protected access modifier.
