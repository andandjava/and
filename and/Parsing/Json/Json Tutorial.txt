JSON: JavaScript Object Notation.
JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.
JSON is an easier-to-use alternative to XML.

Json Example
------------
The following JSON example defines an employees object, with an array of 3 employee records:

{"employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]}

XML Example
-----------
The following XML example also defines an employees object with 3 employee records:
<employees>
    <employee>
        <firstName>John</firstName> <lastName>Doe</lastName>
    </employee>
    <employee>
        <firstName>Anna</firstName> <lastName>Smith</lastName>
    </employee>
    <employee>
        <firstName>Peter</firstName> <lastName>Jones</lastName>
    </employee>
</employees>

What is JSON?
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
JSON is language independent *
JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

* JSON uses JavaScript syntax, but the JSON format is text only, just like XML.
Text can be read and used as a data format by any programming language.

Introduction
=============
JSON - Evaluates to JavaScript Objects
The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects.

Because of this similarity, instead of using a parser (like XML does), a JavaScript program can use standard JavaScript functions to convert JSON data into native JavaScript objects.


JSON Example
=============
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JSON Object Creation in JavaScript</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var text = '{"name":"John Johnson","street":"Oslo West 16","phone":"555 1234567"}';

var obj = JSON.parse(text);

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
obj.name + "<br>" +
obj.street + "<br>" +
obj.phone;
</script>

</body>
</html>

output
======
JSON Object Creation in JavaScript

John Johnson
Oslo West 16
555 1234567

 Much Like XML Because
=======================
Both JSON and XML is "self describing" (human readable)
Both JSON and XML is hierarchichal (values within values)
Both JSON and XML can be parsed and used by lots of programming languages
Both JSON and XML can be fetched with an XMLHttpRequest

Much Unlike XML Because
======================
JSON doesn't use end tag
JSON is shorter
JSON is quicker to read and write
JSON can use arrays
The biggest difference is:

 XML has to be parsed with an XML parser, JSON can be parsed by a standard JavaScript function.

Why JSON?
========
For AJAX applications, JSON is faster and easier than XML:

Using XML
--------
Fetch an XML document
Use the XML DOM to loop through the document
Extract values and store in variables

Using JSON
----------
Fetch a JSON string
JSON.Parse the JSON string
