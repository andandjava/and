MediaController
===============
A view containing controls for a MediaPlayer. Typically contains the buttons like "Play/Pause", "Rewind", "Fast Forward" and a progress slider. It takes care of synchronizing the controls with the state of the MediaPlayer.

The way to use this class is to instantiate it programatically. The MediaController will create a default set of controls and put them in a window floating above your application. Specifically, the controls will float above the view specified with setAnchorView(). The window will disappear if left idle for three seconds and reappear when the user touches the anchor view.

Functions like show() and hide() have no effect when MediaController is created in an xml layout. MediaController will hide and show the buttons according to these rules:

The "previous" and "next" buttons are hidden until setPrevNextListeners() has been called
The "previous" and "next" buttons are visible but disabled if setPrevNextListeners() was called with null listeners
The "rewind" and "fastforward" buttons are shown unless requested otherwise by using the MediaController(Context, boolean) constructor with the boolean set to false
